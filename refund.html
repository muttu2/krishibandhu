    <h1>Refund and Returns Policy</h1>
    <p>Refund and Returns Policy:</p>
    <p>Thank you for shopping with us! We want to ensure your satisfaction with your purchase. Please review our refund and returns policy below:</p>
    <p>Timeframe: Our refund and returns policy is valid for 30 days from the date of purchase. If 30 days have passed since your purchase, we regret to inform you that we cannot offer a full refund or exchange.</p>
    <p>Eligibility: To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused and in the same condition as when you received it. It should also be in its original packaging.</p>
    <p>Exempted Items: Certain goods are exempt from being returned. These include perishable goods (such as food, flowers, newspapers, or magazines), intimate or sanitary goods, hazardous materials, and flammable liquids or gases. Additionally, gift cards, downloadable software products, and some health and personal care items are non-returnable.</p>
    <p>Proof of Purchase: To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase. Please ensure you have this available when initiating a return.</p>
    <p>Manufacturer Returns: Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer. Follow the instructions provided below for returning the item to us.</p>
    <p>Partial Refunds: There are situations where only partial refunds are granted:</p>
    <p>Books with obvious signs of use</p>
    <p>Opened items such as CDs, DVDs, VHS tapes, software, video games, cassette tapes, or vinyl records</p>
    <p>Items that are not in their original condition, are damaged, or have missing parts not due to our error</p>
    <p>Items returned more than 30 days after delivery</p>
    <p>Refund Process: Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will send you an email to notify you of its receipt and the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, the refund will be processed, and a credit will be applied to your credit card or the original method of payment within a certain number of days.</p>
    <p>Late or Missing Refunds: If you haven’t received your refund yet, please take the following steps:</p>
    <p>Check your bank account again</p>
    <p>Contact your credit card company, as there may be a processing delay</p>
    <p>Contact your bank, as there might be a waiting period before the refund is posted</p>
    <p>If you have completed these steps and still haven’t received your refund, please contact us at krishibandhu.kar@gmail.com for further assistance.</p>
    <p>Sale Items: Only regular priced items are eligible for refunds. Sale items are non-refundable.</p>
    <p>Exchanges: We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange a defective or damaged item for the same one, please send us an email at {email address} and ship the item to: {physical address}.</p>
    <p>Gifts: If the item was marked as a gift and shipped directly to you, you will receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you. If the item wasn’t marked as a gift or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will issue a refund to the gift giver, and they will be notified of the return.</p>
    <p>Shipping Returns: To return your product, please mail it to No. 34/3, First Floor, Himanth Nilaya, next to Aanjeenaya Temple, Herohalli, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560091. You will be responsible for paying the shipping costs for returning the item. Please note that shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund. The time it takes for your exchanged product to reach you may vary depending on your location.</p>
    <p>Additional Considerations: If you are returning expensive items, we recommend using a traceable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We cannot guarantee receipt of your returned item.</p>
    <p>Need Help? If you have any questions or need further assistance regarding refunds and returns, please don’t hesitate to contact us at krishibandhu.kar@gmail.com.</p>
